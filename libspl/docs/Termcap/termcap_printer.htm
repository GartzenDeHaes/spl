 Controlling Printers Attached to Terminals
 ==========================================
 
 Some terminals have attached hardcopy printer ports.  They may be able
 to copy the screen contents to the printer; they may also be able to
 redirect output to the printer.  Termcap does not have anything to tell
 the program whether the redirected output appears also on the screen;
 it does on some terminals but not all.
 
 `ps'
      String of commands to cause the contents of the screen to be
      printed.  If it is absent, the screen contents cannot be printed.
 
 `po'
      String of commands to redirect further output to the printer.
 
 `pf'
      String of commands to terminate redirection of output to the
      printer.  This capability must be present in the description if
      `po' is.
 
 `pO'
      String of commands to redirect output to the printer for next N
      characters of output, regardless of what they are.  Redirection
      will end automatically after N characters of further output.  Until
      then, nothing that is output can end redirection, not even the
      `pf' string if there is one.  The number N should not be more than
      255.
 
      One use of this capability is to send non-text byte sequences
      (such as bit-maps) to the printer.
 
    Most terminals with printers do not support all of `ps', `po' and
 `pO'; any one or two of them may be supported.  To make a program that
 can send output to all kinds of printers, it is necessary to check for
 all three of these capabilities, choose the most convenient of the ones
 that are provided, and use it in its own appropriate fashion.
