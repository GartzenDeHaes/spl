 Wrapping
 ========
 
 "Wrapping" means moving the cursor from the right margin to the left
 margin of the following line.  Some terminals wrap automatically when a
 graphic character is output in the last column, while others do not.
 Most application programs that use termcap need to know whether the
 terminal wraps.  There are two special flag capabilities to describe
 what the terminal does when a graphic character is output in the last
 column.
 
 `am'
      Flag whose presence means that writing a character in the last
      column causes the cursor to wrap to the beginning of the next line.
 
      If `am' is not present, writing in the last column leaves the
      cursor at the place where the character was written.
 
      Writing in the last column of the last line should be avoided on
      terminals with `am', as it may or may not cause scrolling to occur
      (<A href="http://docs.biostat.wustl.edu/cgi-bin/info2html?(termcap)Scrolling"> Scrolling</A>).  Scrolling is surely not what you would
      intend.
 
      If your program needs to check the `am' flag, then it also needs
      to check the `xn' flag which indicates that wrapping happens in a
      strange way.  Many common terminals have the `xn' flag.
 
 `xn'
      Flag whose presence means that the cursor wraps in a strange way.
      At least two distinct kinds of strange behavior are known; the
      termcap data base does not contain anything to distinguish the two.
 
      On Concept-100 terminals, output in the last column wraps the
      cursor almost like an ordinary `am' terminal.  But if the next
      thing output is a newline, it is ignored.
 
      DEC VT-100 terminals (when the wrap switch is on) do a different
      strange thing: the cursor wraps only if the next thing output is
      another graphic character.  In fact, the wrap occurs when the
      following graphic character is received by the terminal, before the
      character is placed on the screen.
 
      On both of these terminals, after writing in the last column a
      following graphic character will be displayed in the first column
      of the following line.  But the effect of relative cursor motion
      characters such as newline or backspace at such a time depends on
      the terminal.  The effect of erase or scrolling commands also
      depends on the terminal.  You can't assume anything about what
      they will do on a terminal that has `xn'.  So, to be safe, you
      should never do these things at such a time on such a terminal.
 
      To be sure of reliable results on a terminal which has the `xn'
      flag, output a `cm' absolute positioning command after writing in
      the last column.  Another safe thing to do is to output
      carriage-return newline, which will leave the cursor at the
      beginning of the following line.
 
 `LP'
      Flag whose presence means that it is safe to write in the last
      column of the last line without worrying about undesired
      scrolling.  `LP' indicates the DEC flavor of `xn' strangeness.
