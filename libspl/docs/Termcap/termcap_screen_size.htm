 Screen Size
 ===========
 
 A terminal description has two capabilities, `co' and `li', that
 describe the screen size in columns and lines.  But there is more to
 the question of screen size than this.
 
    On some operating systems the "screen" is really a window and the
 effective width can vary.  On some of these systems, `tgetnum' uses the
 actual width of the window to decide what value to return for the `co'
 capability, overriding what is actually written in the terminal
 description.  On other systems, it is up to the application program to
 check the actual window width using a system call.  For example, on BSD
 4.3 systems, the system call `ioctl' with code `TIOCGWINSZ' will tell
 you the current screen size.
 
    On all window systems, termcap is powerless to advise the application
 program if the user resizes the window.  Application programs must deal
 with this possibility in a system-dependent fashion.  On some systems
 the C shell handles part of the problem by detecting changes in window
 size and setting the `TERMCAP' environment variable appropriately.
 This takes care of application programs that are started subsequently.
 It does not help application programs already running.
 
    On some systems, including BSD 4.3, all programs using a terminal get
 a signal named `SIGWINCH' whenever the screen size changes.  Programs
 that use termcap should handle this signal by using `ioctl TIOCGWINSZ'
 to learn the new screen size.
 
 `co'
      Numeric value, the width of the screen in character positions.
      Even hardcopy terminals normally have a `co' capability.
 
 `li'
      Numeric value, the height of the screen in lines.
