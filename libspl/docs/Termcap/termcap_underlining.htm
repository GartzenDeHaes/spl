 Underlining
 ===========
 
 Underlining on most terminals is a kind of appearance mode, much like
 standout mode.  Therefore, it may be implemented using magic cookies or
 as a flag in the terminal whose current state affects each character
 that is output.  <A href="http://docs.biostat.wustl.edu/cgi-bin/info2html?(termcap)Standout"> Standout</A>, for a full explanation.
 
    The `ug' capability is a numeric capability whose presence indicates
 that the terminal uses magic cookies for underlining.  Its value is the
 number of character positions that a magic cookie for underlining
 occupies; it is used for underlining just as `sg' is used for standout.
 Aside from the simplest applications, it is impossible to use
 underlining correctly without paying attention to the value of `ug'.
 
 `us'
      String of commands to turn on underline mode or to output a magic
      cookie to start underlining.
 
 `ue'
      String of commands to turn off underline mode or to output a magic
      cookie to stop underlining.
 
 `ug'
      Width of magic cookie that represents a change of underline mode;
      or missing, if the terminal does not use a magic cookie for this.
 
 `ms'
      Flag whose presence means that it is safe to move the cursor while
      the appearance modes are not in the normal state.  Underlining is
      an appearance mode.  If this flag is absent, programs should
      always turn off underlining before moving the cursor.
 
    There are two other, older ways of doing underlining: there can be a
 command to underline a single character, or the output of `_', the
 ASCII underscore character, as an overstrike could cause a character to
 be underlined.  New programs need not bother to handle these
 capabilities unless the author cares strongly about the obscure
 terminals which support them.  However, terminal descriptions should
 provide these capabilities when appropriate.
 
 `uc'
      String of commands to underline the character under the cursor, and
      move the cursor right.
 
 `ul'
      Flag whose presence means that the terminal can underline by
      overstriking an underscore character (`_'); some terminals can do
      this even though they do not support overstriking in general.  An
      implication of this flag is that when outputting new text to
      overwrite old text, underscore characters must be treated
      specially lest they underline the old text instead.
