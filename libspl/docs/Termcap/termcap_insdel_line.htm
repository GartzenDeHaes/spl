 Insert/Delete Line
 ==================
 
 "Inserting a line" means creating a blank line in the middle of the
 screen, and pushing the existing lines of text apart.  In fact, the
 lines above the insertion point do not change, while the lines below
 move down, and one is normally lost at the bottom of the screen.
 
    "Deleting a line" means causing the line to disappear from the
 screen, closing up the gap by moving the lines below it upward.  A new
 line appears at the bottom of the screen.  Usually this line is blank,
 but on terminals with the `db' flag it may be a line previously moved
 off the screen bottom by scrolling or line insertion.
 
    Insertion and deletion of lines is useful in programs that maintain
 an updating display some parts of which may get longer or shorter.
 They are also useful in editors for scrolling parts of the screen, and
 for redisplaying after lines of text are killed or inserted.
 
    Many terminals provide commands to insert or delete a single line at
 the cursor position.  Some provide the ability to insert or delete
 several lines with one command, using the number of lines to insert or
 delete as a parameter.  Always move the cursor to column zero before
 using any of these commands.
 
 `al'
      String of commands to insert a blank line before the line the
      cursor is on.  The existing line, and all lines below it, are
      moved down.  The last line in the screen (or in the scroll region,
      if one is set) disappears and in most circumstances is discarded.
      It may not be discarded if the `db' is present (<A href="http://docs.biostat.wustl.edu/cgi-bin/info2html?(termcap)Scrolling"> Scrolling</A>).
 
      The cursor must be at the left margin before this command is used.
      This command does not move the cursor.
 
 `dl'
      String of commands to delete the line the cursor is on.  The
      following lines move up, and a blank line appears at the bottom of
      the screen (or bottom of the scroll region).  If the terminal has
      the `db' flag, a nonblank line previously pushed off the screen
      bottom may reappear at the bottom.
 
      The cursor must be at the left margin before this command is used.
      This command does not move the cursor.
 
 `AL'
      String of commands to insert N blank lines before the line that
      the cursor is on.  It is like `al' repeated N times, except that
      it is as fast as one `al'.
 
 `DL'
      String of commands to delete N lines starting with the line that
      the cursor is on.  It is like `dl' repeated N times, except that
      it is as fast as one `dl'.
 
    Any terminal description that defines `AL' should also define `al';
 likewise for `DL' and `dl'.  However, many terminals can only insert or
 delete one line at a time, so it is common to find `al' and not `AL',
 or `dl' without `DL'.
 
    Therefore, all programs that use the insert and delete facilities
 should be prepared to work with `al' in the case that `AL' is absent,
 and likewise with `dl'.  On the other hand, it is acceptable to write
 an application that uses only `al' and `dl' and does not look for `AL'
 or `DL' at all.
 
    If a terminal does not support line insertion and deletion directly,
 but does support a scroll region, the effect of insertion and deletion
 can be obtained with scrolling.  However, it is up to the individual
 user program to check for this possibility and use the scrolling
 commands to get the desired result.  It is fairly important to implement
 this alternate strategy, since it is the only way to get the effect of
 line insertion and deletion on the popular VT100 terminal.
 
    Insertion and deletion of lines is affected by the scroll region on
 terminals that have a settable scroll region.  This is useful when it is
 desirable to move any few consecutive lines up or down by a few lines.
 <A href="http://docs.biostat.wustl.edu/cgi-bin/info2html?(termcap)Scrolling"> Scrolling</A>.
 
    The line pushed off the bottom of the screen is not lost if the
 terminal has the `db' flag capability; instead, it is pushed into
 display memory that does not appear on the screen.  This is the same
 thing that happens when scrolling pushes a line off the bottom of the
 screen.  Either reverse scrolling or deletion of a line can bring the
 apparently lost line back onto the bottom of the screen.  If the
 terminal has the scroll region feature as well as `db', the pushed-out
 line really is lost if a scroll region is in effect.
 
    When outputting an insert or delete command with `tputs', the NLINES
 argument should be the total number of lines from the cursor to the
 bottom of the screen (or scroll region).  Very often these commands
 require padding proportional to this number of lines.  <A href="http://docs.biostat.wustl.edu/cgi-bin/info2html?(termcap)Padding"> Padding</A>.
 
    For `AL' and `DL' the NLINES argument should _not_ depend on the
 number of lines inserted or deleted; only the total number of lines
 affected.  This is because it is just as fast to insert two or N lines
 with `AL' as to insert one line with `al'.
