- Probabably should link to PCRE, or find a lighter alternative.

- Add array capability to Variant

- Thread::Sleep() doesn't seem to work on linux.

- Create a JavaScript interpreter as an example project.

- Environment::UserName() segfaults sometimes.

- Need a timeout file stream that closes the file after a period of
  inactivity and automaticly reopens it on next use.

- RedBlackTree unit tests are commented out.

- Maybe Socket, TcpSocket, and UdpSocket should have copy constructors?

- XmlNode::SelectSingleNode processes all nodes -- need to stop afte
  finding one.

- String ToUTF16, ToUTF32; UTF handling in general.

- ZIP or other compression support, link to zlib.

- SMTP mail (?).

- FTP client (?).

- Use stringize "#" in ASSERT macro to print condition in debugAssert.

- Change all calls to GetLastError and errno to use 
  Environment::LastErrorMessage.

- Implement BigInteger ToString and Parse.

- Make tiny xml qname aware (seperate namespace from note name).

- Int64 and UInt64 don't support hex for IsInt and Parse.

- TinyXML doesn't like ^M (line feeds) in its XML files.  Technically, this
is correct behavior.

- Should probably disable recursive mutex on windows, to make behavior
of Mutex consistant.  By default, recursion is on for windows, off for
linux, and not available on tandem.

- Modify Mutex so that windows mutexes are non-recurrsive.  Recursive
  mutexes aren't supported on Tandem OSS -- OR create a recusive mutex
  for Tandem.

- Create a define for debug new that includes __FILE__ & __LINE__

- String::Format needs to handle floating point %f %lf.

- Fix NULL field handling by Recordset.

- Smarten up List.ItemAt so that it doesn't scan the list to find the index.
  Maybe not, Vector or Array should be used for indexed access?

- Figure out how to get project level reports from gcov

- Port my C# flat file support classes to C++?  The ".h" files are in
  the project now, but they still contain c#.

- Add heap size limit to debug.cpp -- allow testing of out-of-memory
  conditions.

- Create an HttpWebRequest class.
