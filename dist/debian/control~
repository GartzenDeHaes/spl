Description: The Standard Portable Library
 A dotnet/Java style core framework for C++.  It uses reference count pointers to avoid deep copy constructors and has the expected types, collections, IO, network, thread, and other classes common in these frameworks.  Note: this library uses Pascal case, which some may dislike.
